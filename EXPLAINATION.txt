The Healthcare Crisis
Why Early Disease Detection Matters
10M+
TB Cases Annually
2.5M
Pneumonia Deaths
60%
Lack Expert Care
The Reality: In Resource-Limited Healthcare Settings, Access To Skilled Radiologists And Advanced Diagnostic Tools Is Severely Restricted. Manual Analysis Of Medical Images Is Slow, Requires Specialized Expertise, And Often Leads To Delayed
Diagnosis.
Critical Challenges
Limited Access To Trained Radiologists In Rural And Remote Areas
Time-Consuming Manual Interpretation Of X-Rays And CT Scans
High Risk Of Misdiagnosis Due To Human Error And Fatigue
Delayed Treatment Leading To Disease Progression And Mortality

MediScan Al
Hybrid CNN Architecture
Input Layer → Image (512x512 Grayscale)
ResNet-50 Backbone - Feature Extraction
Attention Module Focus On Relevant Regions
Multi-Head Classification - TB/Pneumonia / Fracture
Segmentation Branch Contour Mapping
Output → Class Probability + Heatmap + Contours







Contour Mapping Technology
Precise Localization of Abnormalities
What Is Contour Mapping? Advanced Image Processing Technique That Creates Visual Overlays On Medical Scans, Clearly Delineating Abnormal Regions Such As Lesions, Infiltrates, And Fractures.
Technical Implementation
U-Net Segmentation: Pixel-Level Classification Of Abnormal Tissue
Edge Detection: Canny And Sobel Operators For Precise Boundaries
Morphological Operations: Noise Reduction And Contour Refinement
Color-Coded Overlays: Red For High-Risk, Yellow For Moderate Concern
Visualization Pipeline :
Raw Image → Probability Heatmap → Threshold Application → Contour Detection → Overlay Generation → Final Annotated Image
Clinical Impact: Healthcare Workers Can Instantly Identify Problem Areas Without Extensive Radiology Training, Reducing Diagnostic Time From Hours To Seconds.








Explainable AI (XAI)
Building Trust Through Transparency
"Black Box" Models Are Not Acceptable In Healthcare. Our System Explains Every Decision It Makes.
XAI Techniques Implemented
Grad-CАM
Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Mapping Highlights Which Regions Influenced The Diagnosis
LIME
Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations For Feature Importance
Attention Maps
Visual Representation Of Where The Model "Looks" During Analysis
Feature Attribution
Quantifies The Contribution Of Each Image Region To Final Prediction
Why It Matters: Explainability Increases Clinician Trust, Enables Validation Of Model Decisions, Facilitates Learning For Healthcare Workers, And Ensures Regulatory Compliance For Medical Al Systems.
